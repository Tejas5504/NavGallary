NavGallary - A Personal Media Gallery
NavGallary is a dynamic and secure full-stack web application designed for users to upload, manage, and browse their personal collection of photos and videos. It features a secure authentication system, a personal gallery for each user, and a sleek, modern user interface.

(Suggestion: Replace the placeholder above with a screenshot or a GIF of your running application.)

‚ú® Key Features
Secure User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to a personal account. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt, and sessions are managed with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Personal Media Gallery: Once logged in, users have access to a private gallery where they can view all their uploaded media. All gallery operations (view, upload, delete) are tied to the specific user ID.

Photo & Video Uploads: An intuitive interface allows users to upload new images and videos with a description. The backend uses multer for efficient file handling.

Dynamic Search & Filtering:

The main gallery page includes a real-time search bar to find media by its description.

The "Shortcuts" page provides one-click filters to view only images or only videos.

External API Integration: The "Exhibits" page fetches and displays a grid of random beautiful images from the public Picsum Photos API, offering new content to view on each visit.

Protected Routes: The application uses a protected routing system, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the main content like the gallery and shortcuts.

Responsive Sidebar Navigation: A collapsible sidebar provides easy navigation between different sections of the application.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites
You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (which includes npm)

MySQL Server

1. Backend Setup
First, set up the server which will handle the API and database interactions.

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# 2. Navigate to the backend directory (assuming it's where server.js is located)
cd your-repo-name/

# 3. Install NPM packages
npm install

Database Configuration:

Start your MySQL server.

Create a new database for the project. In the server.js file, the database is named NavGallary_db.

CREATE DATABASE NavGallary_db;

Connect to your new database and run the following SQL commands to create the necessary tables.

-- Create the 'users' table for storing login credentials
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create the 'gallery' table for storing media information
CREATE TABLE gallery (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(255),
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

Update the database connection details in server.js with your own MySQL credentials.

// server.js
const dbConfig = {
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_mysql_user',
    password: 'your_mysql_password',
    database: 'NavGallary_db'
};

Start the backend server:

node server.js

The server should now be running on http://localhost:3001.

2. Frontend Setup
Now, set up the React client.

# 1. Navigate to the frontend directory from the root folder
# (Assuming your React app is in a subfolder like 'client' or 'frontend')
cd ../client/ 

# 2. Install NPM packages
npm install

# 3. Start the React development server
npm run dev

Your React application should now be running, and you can access it in your browser, typically at http://localhost:5173.

üìã API Endpoints
The backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints.

Method

Endpoint

Protection

Description

POST

/api/register

Public

Registers a new user.

POST

/api/login

Public

Logs in a user and returns a JWT.

GET

/api/gallery

Private

Fetches all media for the authenticated user.

POST

/api/upload

Private

Uploads a new photo or video for the user.

DELETE

/api/gallery/:id

Private

Deletes a specific media item for the user.

üí° Future Improvements
Environment Variables: Move sensitive information like database credentials and JWT secrets to a .env file for better security.

Album Creation: Add functionality for users to organize their media into albums.

UI/UX Enhancements: Implement loading spinners, better error feedback, and modal pop-ups for a smoother user experience.

Pagination: For galleries with many items, add pagination to improve performance and reduce initial load time.

File Editing: Allow users to edit the description of an already uploaded media item.
